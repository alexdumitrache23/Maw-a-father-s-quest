# Story
Maw, a stray cat, was taking care of his kitten, Pippin. One day, two men from the animal shelter showed up. They both tried to run, but the men managed to catch Pippin and drove off, with Maw watching.
To get his kitten back, Maw set off on a quest, he first had to travel through the city sewers, where he fought his way through packs of rats. After getting out, he was injured and weak. He found his favorite food, lasagna, which healed him and gave him the strength to continue.
Finally, Maw reached the animal shelter. He snuck inside, found where Pippin was being kept, and rescued him. They fled the shelter and ran all the way back to their old alley. They were back on the streets, but they were free and together again.
